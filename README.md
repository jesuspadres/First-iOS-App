# First-iOS-App
// This application contains a three page scrollview that demonstrates knowledge and execution of an app on swift. 
The first page contains a brief description of me and a tap animation; the second page contains a sorting algorithm visualizer; 
and the third page contains a tic-tac-toe game.

This application is what I created as I was teaching myself how to create iOS apps.
* Adapted only for the iPhone 12 pro *
